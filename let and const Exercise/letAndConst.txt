1.What is the difference between var and let?

The main difference between let and var is  in their scoping behavior.
Variables declared with var are function-scoped meaning they are accessible throughout the entire function in which they are declared.
But variables declared with let are block-scoped, meaning they are only accessible within the block in which they are defined.
Another difference between var and let is Hoisting. The other difference betweenthem is that let creates block scope.


2.What is the difference between var and const?

The main difference between var and const in JavaScript is that var is used for variable declaration with function or global scope and allows reassignment
while const is used for declaring constants that cannot be reassigned after initialization.And like let , const creates block scope

3.What is the difference between let and const?

The main difference between let and const in JavaScript is their mutability
Variables declared with let can be reassigned to a different value.
Constants declared with const cannot be reassigned once they are initialized

4.What is hoisting?

Hoisting is a JavaScript behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope
during the compilation phase, before the code is executed. This means that regardless of where a variable or function is
declared within its scope, it is treated as if it were declared at the top.
